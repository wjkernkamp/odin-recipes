    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Typically, the dutch egg is served for lunch on Sundays in the Netherlands. There it is just called an egg sandwich. My father used to make these for us for breakfast so it is clearly a versatile food that can be eaten at any time of the day or week!</p>
    <p>These are very simple so the recipe is just a guideline. Add as much bacon as you want and don't be afraid to add other things too such as hot sauce, cilantro, or garlic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>one egg</li>
        <li>two bacon strips</li>
        <li>two bread slices</li>
        <li>mayo</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your pan. </li>
        <li>Add the bacon to the pan</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is mostly cooked crack the egg on top of the two bacon strips</li>
        <li>Flip your egg and season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Add mayo to your bread. (I like to toast my bread)</li>
